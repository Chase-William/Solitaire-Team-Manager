# Solitaire Team Manager [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

Solitaire Team Manager is an early-stage management app where you can organize your project. The app’s objective is to allow the user to create projects and structure them effectively using the app. The personal objective is for this to be a great learning experience.

  - A Board is like the project, it contains all the contents that make up the project. It's the main wrapper for everything that has to do with that project. 
  - A Deck is a container inside the board that will hold all the user’s objectives. 
  - A Card is a task or requirement that needs to be completed.
  - A Contributor is an individual who can be added to cards to contribute towards its completion.

## Main Features 

  - Add collapsible decks to a board
  - Add cards to decks
  - Add contributors to any cards
  - Cards can be moved to different decks 
  - Cards can be marked as finished
  - Remove or Add contributors to cards
  - Mark cards as finished and show or hide them from view
